// Nullish Coalescing operator (??)


// The Nullish Coalescing operator in JavaScript is represented by two question marks (??)

// The nullish coalescing operator (??) returns the second operand (op2) if the first operand (op1) is null or undefined

// it is used to set the default value for the place of value null

// EX :
let x = null;
let y = x ?? 5;
      
      console.log(y);
